title: Seismic velocity changes in response to different direction of tidal strain
type: presentation
---

During the EGU General Assembly 2018, I presented a work on characteristics of strain sensitivity of seismic velocity changes.

In particular I talked about the seismic velocity changes in response to different direction of tidal strain by using ambient noise recorded at active volcanoes in Japan.
