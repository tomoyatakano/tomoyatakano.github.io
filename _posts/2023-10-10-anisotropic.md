In this paper, we investigated anisotropic seismic velocity changes in different orientations of tidal deformation. We observed an azimuthal dependence of velocity changes for the station-pair and strain directions. Moreover, we roughly estimated the third-order elastic parameters at a crustal scale from the anisotropic velocity changes of tidal deformations.
