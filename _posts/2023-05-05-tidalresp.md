>Takano, T. and K. Nishida, 2023, Tidal response of seismic wave velocity at shallow crust in Japan, Geophysical Research Letters, 50(9), e2023GL103011. [[PDF]](/papers/TakanoNishida2023.pdf)

To systematically evaluate the tidal response to velocity variations, we developed a new method that utilized the flexibility of a state-space model. We extracted the tidal response from hourly stacked noise autocorrelations using a seismic interferometry method throughout Japan. In particular, large tide-induced seismic velocity changes were observed in the low S-wave velocity region of the shallow crust. The tidal responses of velocity variations can provide new insights into the response mechanisms of the shallow crust to applied strain.
