<p>During the EGU General Assembly 2018, I presented a work on characteristics of strain sensitivity of seismic velocity changes.</p>

<p>In particular I talked about the seismic velocity changes in response to different direction of tidal strain by using ambient noise recorded at active volcanoes in Japan.</p>
