title: AGUãƒ»Seismic velocity changes in response to different direction of tidal strain
type: presentation
---

During the AGU Fall Meeting 2017, I presented a work on characteristics of strain sensitivity of seismic velocity changes.

I talked about the seismic velocity changes in response to tidal strains at different lapse-times. In the presentation, I discussed the observed velocity changes with the wave properties of Green's function by applying an array analysis to cross-correlation functions of ambient noise.
