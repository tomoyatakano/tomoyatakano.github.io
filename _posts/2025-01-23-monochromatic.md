>Takano, T. and Poli, P. (2025). Coherence-based characterization of a long-period monochromatic seismic signal, Geophysical Research Letters, 52, e2024GL113290. [https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL113290](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL113290){:target="_blank"}

We explore long-period monochromatic signals globally. We identified the 26s microseisms from Vanuatu and gulf of Guinea, signals from submarine volcanic activities, and a previously unknown signals from glacier dynamics in the Canadian Arctic region.
